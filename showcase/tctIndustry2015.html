        <p>The Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (<em>TCT</em>)  is an annual conference hosted by CRF focusing on the future of interventional cardiology. Each year CRF invites millions of medical professional and scholars to join them at TCT. In 2015 CRF invited special guest speakers Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carlo Ancelotti. </p>
        <p>TCT is updated yearly for CRF Annual TCT Conference. As the Junior Front End Developer at CRF I worked along a team of designers and developers to develop the TCT materials each year. From 2013-2017 I was the front end developer at CRF. Each year I handled the development of 8 – 15 TCT related websites for conferences, sponsors, and partners. As well as the front end development of TCT Industry website, App features and various related interfaces. In addition to website development I handled the development of over 200 emails sent each year through Salesforce’s Pardot on behalf of CRF, TCT, sponsors, and partners.</p>
        <p>The TCT Industry website is a Joomla website built in bootstrap, jQuery, Javascript and just about any tool that accomplished the task. TCT website housed dynamic schedules built using various technologies including Ajax, Restful Api and Javascript. </p>
        <p>At CRF I handled all the development of smaller websites, majority of all front end development at the company and all of the CRF publication emails.</p>
